After the news of [Brenden Eich
resigning](http://www.zdnet.com/mozilla-ceo-brendan-eich-resigns-amid-controversy-7000028041/)
because it was discovered he had donated $1000 to an anti gay marriage campaign
I felt like writing the following:

### Employees do not reflect on the company's image

The author of this blog is a consequentianalist, meaning that the merit of the
above social norm is decided upon the impact on the society.

Arguments against the above social norm:

1. Unpopular beliefs dying out. The less people voice their support for a
belief X, the less people will, ultimately, support X.

    *Rebuttal:* We are encouraging people to use a consensus fallacy, i.e.
    deciding upon truths by how many people believe in it. Truth is not a
    popularity contest. We only establish the truth using *evidence*. The fact
    the everyone believes it to be true is not decisive enough and there was a
    number of occasions when the public was wrong about facts.

    There can still be a disagreement on an issues when people in question
    don't share common values, however by institutionalising social norms we
    are further distancing the public from realising *where* exactly the
    disagreement lies.

    We are discouraging public debate about certain things which can only lead
    to further manipulation of the public opinion, since we are discouraging
    people from evaluating the arguments themselves.
    It is more beneficial if the stupid beliefs died out by the means of a
    debate where arguments for the beliefs are countered one by one in a manner
    I am presenting here.
2. Higher customer satisfaction: a number of people want their products to only
come from those who share their beliefs.

    *Rebuttal:* We are only encouraging a cognitive bias by association.
    Instead of encouraging people to think about how much of an impact
    employees' opinions have on the quality of the products we put greater
    value on how people *feel* about the products. I would rather we encouraged
    people to learn how to counter some of their emotions - such a skill could
    be more valuable overtime.

    However, for the rest of the people, who are
    really unhappy when forced to deal with their emotions,
    I do not expect this to be a major benefit, as I would imagine that most
    people do not have a strong opinion on most of the controversial
    topics. I can imagine that most of the time people will also have a
    competing option to choose from.
3. Higher employee satisfaction: a number of people are not comfortable with
the idea of working for a company where employees voice unpopular views.

    *Rebuttal:* Again, promoting association bias. However, there is even
    more important counter argument: increasing fear of losing jobs and becoming less
    competitive candidates. There is a reason I write this blog anonymously:
    companies might not be happy about hiring people who agree with the above social
    norm. And despite the fact the most people don't have an opinion on most
    controversial topics, the negative of losing a job is so large, that it
    easily makes up for that.
